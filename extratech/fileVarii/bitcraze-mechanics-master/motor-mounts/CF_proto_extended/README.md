This is an extended version of 'CF_mm_proto' that took ~5 mins to
generate.

It proved too difficult to remove support materials, so I couldn't even test
it. 

This design should probably be dremeled down for weight reduction and is a
hatchet job at best, but I wanted to get an idea of the feasibility of this
before spending 30 mins-1 hr designing something new since acquiring the
original CAD files to this open source hardware/software has proven to be
difficult. You're killin' me bitcraze. But have roped me into this rewarding
hobby!
